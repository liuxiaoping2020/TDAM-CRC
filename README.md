## Abstract
Colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibits substantial heterogeneity, and conventional TNM staging is insufficient for individualized prognosis. We developed TDAM-CRC (Transformer–Dynamic Agent–Mamba for CRC), a novel multiple instance learning model based on histopathological whole-slide images, to achieve precise prognostic stratification and explore underlying molecular mechanisms. The model was trained on the TCGA-COADREAD cohort (n = 581) and externally validated in an independent dataset (n = 1,031). TDAM-CRC–derived risk scores robustly predicted overall survival and outperformed both TNM staging and state-of-the-art models. Integrative pathomic–transcriptomic analyses revealed that the high-risk subtype was characterized by metabolic reprogramming and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Network analysis identified MRPL37 as a key hub gene linking deep learning–derived pathological features to prognosis; its elevated expression, driven by promoter hypomethylation, was associated with favorable outcomes. A nomogram integrating TDAM-CRC with clinical factors provided an interpretable tool for individualized prognostic assessment in CRC.
